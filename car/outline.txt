using pygame for display
using pybox2d for physics

fitness based on distance and speed
kill once speed is 0m/s for ____ frames

Time Limit or limit track length?

NEED:
draw based on positions and orientations from physics simulation
follow car that is the farthest at that instant
generate model car from genome
population
individuals
genome with mutation functions
Generate a track for the cars and display (change every generation?)

NICE:
Toggleable ability to run at faster speed; without displaying and without changing physics simulation


Genome:
Wheels:
Wheel size
Wheel position
Powered
Friction
Body
Density
Size
